## Karigor - Online Car Workshop Appointment System

This project is developed for the **CSE391 – Programming for the Internet** course assignment. It addresses the need for a more efficient appointment system in a car workshop that employs five senior mechanics. The goal is to eliminate in-person chaos and streamline the mechanic assignment process using an online booking system.

## Features

### User Panel (Client Side)
- Clients can book an appointment online without visiting the workshop.
- Inputs required from client:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Phone Number
  - Car License Number
  - Car Engine Number
  - Preferred Appointment Date
  - Desired Mechanic (from the list of available mechanics)
- A mechanic can be assigned to **a maximum of 4 active cars per day**.
- If the desired mechanic is fully booked, they will not appear in the available list.
- Clients can not book multiple appointments for the same day.

### Admin Panel
- Admin can view all booked appointments with the following details:
  - Client Name
  - Phone Number
  - Car License Number
  - Appointment Date
  - Assigned Mechanic
- Admin can:
  - Modify the appointment date
  - Reassign mechanics (only if the target mechanic has less than 4 assignments)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Production), SQLite (Local Development)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Blade Templates (Laravel)
- **Deployment:** Render.com (Live Demo)


## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, you need to install the following software on your system:

### 1. Install Git

**Windows:**
- Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
- Accept default settings for most options

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### 2. Install PHP 8.x

**Windows:**
- Download PHP from [https://windows.php.net/download/](https://windows.php.net/download/)
- Choose "Thread Safe" version for your architecture (x64 or x86)
- Extract to `C:\php` (or your preferred location)
- Add PHP to your system PATH:
  - Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
  - Add `C:\php` to your PATH variable
- Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and run `php -v`

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php8.3 php8.3-cli php8.3-xml php8.3-sqlite3 php8.3-mbstring php8.3-curl php8.3-zip
```

### 3. Install Composer

**Windows:**
- Download Composer installer from [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- Run `Composer-Setup.exe` and follow the installation wizard
- Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and run `composer --version`

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install composer
```

### 4. Verify Installation

After installing all prerequisites, verify your setup:
```bash
git --version
php -v
composer --version
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/badhon495/Karigor
   cd Karigor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Set up the environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. Configure database in `.env`:

   **For Local Development (SQLite - Recommended for beginners):**
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
   DB_DATABASE=./database/database.sqlite
   ```
   
   **For Production or Advanced Setup (PostgreSQL):**
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=your-postgres-host
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=your-database-name
   DB_USERNAME=your-username
   DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```
   
   **Note:** The live demo uses PostgreSQL, but for local development, SQLite is easier to set up.

5. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

7. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Live Demo

You can try the live demo of this website here: [https://karigor.onrender.com/](https://karigor.onrender.com/)

*Note: As this is deployed on a free hosting service, the server may take up to one minute to boot if it has been idle.*

## Roles

- **Clients** can book appointments with available mechanics.
- **Admin** has full control over managing and updating appointments.

## Important Instructions

1. The administrative interface is not visible to regular users on any public-facing pages. The admin login page can be accessed via: [http://localhost:8000/admin/login](http://localhost:8000/admin/login)
2. The default administrator email is `admin@gmail.com` and the default password is `admin123`.
3. Once logged into the admin panel, you have the ability to add mechanics. These added mechanics will then be available for selection when users book appointments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. "Please provide a valid cache path" Error:**

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install php8.3-mbstring php8.3-xml php8.3-curl php8.3-zip php8.3-sqlite3
```

**4. Composer Install Fails:**
```bash
composer clear-cache
