## Overview

This project is developed for the **CSE391 â€“ Programming for the Internet** course assignment. It addresses the need for a more efficient appointment system in a car workshop that employs five senior mechanics. The goal is to eliminate in-person chaos and streamline the mechanic assignment process using an online booking system.

## Features

### User Panel (Client Side)
- Clients can book an appointment online without visiting the workshop.
- Inputs required from client:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Phone Number
  - Car License Number
  - Car Engine Number
  - Preferred Appointment Date
  - Desired Mechanic (from the list of available mechanics)
- A mechanic can be assigned to **a maximum of 4 active cars per day**.
- If the desired mechanic is fully booked, they will not appear in the available list.

### Admin Panel
- Admin can view all booked appointments with the following details:
  - Client Name
  - Phone Number
  - Car License Number
  - Appointment Date
  - Assigned Mechanic
- Admin can:
  - Modify the appointment date
  - Reassign mechanics (only if the target mechanic has less than 4 assignments)
